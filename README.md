# FM Signal Simulation Using Python

This repository contains a simple implementation of an FM (Frequency Modulation) signal simulation in Python. It demonstrates the core principles of FM modulation by generating:
- A message signal (audio signal)
- A carrier signal
- An FM modulated signal

## Features
- Visualizes the message, carrier, and modulated signals.
- Uses Python's numerical and plotting libraries (`numpy`, `matplotlib`) to simulate the process.

## Requirements
To run the code, you need:
- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
